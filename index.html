  <p>the first time i heard about programming , i thought maybe i will not be able to learn it
    , people around me were confused why i wanted to learn it and kept adviying me to dont waste my time on it , but i believed i can make it work
    and i started step by step to watch different tutorials and to read more books about it , i cant deny it was hard at first but the same time it was intresting to learn and to see the progress every time i was learning new code then apply it <strong>.</strong>
